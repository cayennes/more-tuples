# More Tuples

A simple game inspired by set, but with more-tuples instead of 4-tuples.  Written in ClojureScript and [om](https://github.com/swannodette/om).  Play it [here](https://cayennes.github.io/more-tuples).

I wrote it because I wanted to play with [devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards) but dropped devcards before finishing due to bad interactions with the lack of idempotency in creating go blocks.  I was still impressed with devcards as a flow for writing code that doesn't go too deep below the GUI.  It synergizes with the modular nature of om.
